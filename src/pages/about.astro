          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            We envision a world where scientific research earns and maintains <strong>public trust</strong> through
            <strong>open</strong>, <strong>transparent</strong>, and <strong>reliable</strong> publishing platforms. The Insight Journal aims to repair
            and strengthen confidence in medical image analysis research by providing a publication
            venue that embraces full <strong>openness</strong> and <strong>reproducibility</strong> through <strong>Decentralized Science (DeSci)</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
          <p>
            Enable reproducible scientific image analysis and visualization research by providing
            an open, interactive, and decentralized platform for publishing manuscripts, data, code,
            and research artifacts.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Values</h2>
          <p>
            The Insight Journal is built on three foundational pillars that align with the principles
            of Decentralized Science (DeSci):
          </p>

          <h3>üîì Open Science</h3>
          <p>
            We champion complete openness in research dissemination and validation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Open Access:</strong> No paywalls or publication charges. All research is freely
                available to everyone, everywhere, forever.</li>
            <li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> All submissions include data, code, and parameters,
                enabling complete verification and reuse. Research that cannot be reproduced cannot be verified.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Open peer-review with visible dialogues between reviewers
                and authors. The review process becomes part of the scientific record, increasing trust
                and accountability.</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Interactive, web-enabled visualizations and modern publishing
                tools (<a href="https://mystmd.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyST</a>, <a href="https://wasm.itk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITK-Wasm</a>) transform passive reading into active exploration and enable
                computational reproducibility.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>üåê Decentralized Infrastructure</h3>
          <p>
            We build resilient, community-owned systems free from centralized control:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Distributed Storage:</strong> Content stored across the <a href="https://ipfs.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interplanetary File System (IPFS)</a> nodes ensures availability
                even if individual servers fail. Many copies keep things safe.</li>
            <li><strong>Verifiable Provenance:</strong> Cryptographic identifiers (<a href="https://dpid.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DPIDs</a>) and blockchain-based
                records create tamper-proof provenance for all contributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Governance:</strong> Decision-making power resides with the community,
                not corporate publishers. The journal's future belongs to its users.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Built on open-source principles with cost-effective
                infrastructure designed for long-term preservation and community ownership.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>ü§ù Community & Incentives</h3>
          <p>
            We recognize and reward all contributions to advance scientific progress:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Contributor Recognition:</strong> All contributors‚Äîauthors, reviewers, data providers‚Äî
                receive formal credit through <a href="https://orcid.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ORCID</a> integration and attestations.</li>
            <li><strong>Reputation Systems:</strong> Quality contributions build verifiable reputation,
                creating incentives aligned with scientific progress rather than publication counts.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Collaboration:</strong> Open participation regardless of institutional
                affiliation, geography, or career stage. Merit is measured by contribution, not credentials.</li>
            <li><strong>Fairness & Equity:</strong> Equal access to publication and review opportunities,
                removing barriers that exclude researchers from underrepresented communities.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Problem with "Publish or Perish"</h2>
          <p>
            The current publishing system has inverted priorities. The motto
            <strong> "Publish or Perish"</strong> reveals
            its corruption‚Äînote that it does not say <strong>"Research or Perish!"</strong> This subtle distinction has
            profound consequences: researchers work "in order to publish" rather than because their work
            has significant impact on society.
          </p>
          <p>
            This system forces researchers to embark only on publishable activities, which discourages
            significant departures from views held by the establishment of experts who serve as journal
            reviewers. Innovation is stifled; conformity is rewarded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Publications are counted for career advancement, not evaluated for quality, relevance, or
            impact. The number of publications in your CV‚Äînot their substance‚Äîmatters when seeking:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A degree</li>
            <li>A job in industry or academia</li>
            <li>A tenure position in a university</li>
            <li>A promotion</li>
            <li>A grant from federal or state agencies</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Scientific Method</h2>
          <p>
            The Scientific Method was introduced by Galileo in the 1500s when he embarked on a series
            of attempts to answer fundamental questions about physics by performing experiments. Galileo
            was also at the center of the first scientific journal, published by the "Linceans," also
            known as the Society of the Lynx. The name derived from the acute vision of this animal,
            conveying the idea that careful observation of experiments was required for finding truth
            about scientific matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            <Image src={galileoPortrait} alt="Portrait of Galileo Galilei by Justus Sustermans" />
            <br />
            <small>Portrait of Galileo Galilei by Justus Sustermans</small>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Insight Journal returns to these principles: careful observation, reproducible experiments,
            and open sharing of methods and results. We seek to support the altruistic motivation of
            performing scientific research rather than the corrupted imperative to publish for career
            advancement.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            To establish the Insight Journal as the premier publication venue in scientific and medical
            image analysis, we aim to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Set global standards for openness and interactive scholarship</li>
            <li>Drive progress toward a truly <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)</a> and
                transparent research ecosystem</li>
            <li>Build robust community governance</li>
            <li>Catalyze scientific collaboration and nurture innovation</li>
            <li>Transform passive reading into active engagement through interactive visualizations</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Sustainable Open Science with Web3 Technology</h2>
          <p>
            The Insight Journal 3 (IJ3) is an innovative undertaking to bring sustainability to
            reproducible research through the power of decentralized Web3 technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The IJ3 is built on a foundation of proven technologies:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Git:</strong> Version control and collaborative development</li>
            <li><strong>InterPlanetary File System (IPFS):</strong> Decentralized storage</li>
            <li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> Blockchain-based verification and provenance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <Image src={merkleTrees} width={480} alt="Merkle tree cartoon" />
            <br />
            <small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">It's Merkle trees all the way down.</a></small>
          </p>
          <p>
            These technologies all share a common foundation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Merkle trees</a>, which provide cryptographic
            verification and tamper-proof records. Every change, every version, every contribution is
            permanently and verifiably recorded.
          </p>

          <h3>FAIR by Design</h3>
          <p>
            The platform's architecture ensures all research objects are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Findable:</strong> Indexed in OpenAlex, CrossRef, and Google Scholar</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> Open access with no paywalls or publication charges</li>
            <li><strong>Interoperable:</strong> Standards-compliant metadata and identifiers</li>
            <li><strong>Reusable:</strong> Open licenses, complete documentation, and included dependencies</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>DeSci Nodes Platform</h2>
          <p>
            The Insight Journal operates on <a href="https://nodes.desci.com/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">DeSci Nodes</a>, a decentralized science
            publication platform that enables researchers to publish and share research objects‚Äînot
            just manuscripts, but complete packages of data, code, visualizations, and documentation.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Features of DeSci Nodes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Research Objects:</strong> Publish manuscripts alongside data, code, images,
                and other artifacts in a single, coherent package</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Track the evolution of research from initial ideas
                through publication and beyond</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent Identifiers (<a href="https://dpid.org" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">DPIDs</a>):</strong> Content-addressed identifiers that
                never break or require maintenance</li>
            <li><strong>Decentralized Storage:</strong> Content stored across multiple nodes on <a href="https://ipfs.tech" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">IPFS</a>,
                ensuring availability and preservation</li>
            <li><strong>CrossRef Integration:</strong> Minting DOIs for published works while maintaining
                deterministic resolution through DPIDs</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://orcid.org" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">ORCID</a> Integration:</strong> Automatic credit for authors and reviewers</li>
            <li><strong>Attestations:</strong> Verifiable claims about research quality, openness, and
                reproducibility</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Addressing Traditional Publishing Limitations</h3>
          <p>
            Traditional publishing suffers from:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Link rot:</strong> Within 3 years, 50% of URIs in scientific publications break;
                nearly all break within a decade</li>
            <li><strong>Content drift:</strong> URLs that resolve but point to different content</li>
            <li><strong>DOI failures:</strong> Traditional DOIs fail to resolve correctly about 50% of the time</li>
            <li><strong>Data silos:</strong> Centralized repositories create single points of failure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            DeSci Nodes with DPIDs solves these problems through content-addressed storage, distributed
            architecture, and cryptographic verification.
          </p>


          <h3>Web3 Principles</h3>
          <p>
            The IJ3 applies Web3 technologies based on three core principles:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Verifiability</h3>
          <p>
            Every component of a research object receives a cryptographic hash-based <a href="https://dpid.org" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">decentralized persistent identifier (DPID)</a> that serves as
            both identifier and integrity check. Any modification‚Äîeven a single pixel or letter‚Äîproduces
            a different hash, ensuring you always retrieve exactly the version you expect.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Decentralization</h3>
          <p>
            Content is stored across multiple independent nodes on the <a href="https://ipfs.tech" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</a>. This distributed model follows
            the principle that "many copies keep things safe." Unlike centralized repositories that create
            single points of failure, decentralized storage ensures content remains available even if
            individual nodes go offline.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Incentive Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            Blockchain-based provenance creates tamper-proof records of contributions. This enables
            reputation-based systems and potentially tokenized rewards for quality peer review, aligning
            individual incentives with the broader goal of scientific progress.
          </p>

          <h2>Modern Publishing with MyST for the AI Age</h2>
          <p>
            The Insight Journal leverages <a href="https://mystmd.org" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">MyST (Markedly Structured Text)</a> to enable
            rich, interactive content that transforms articles from static PDFs into engaging, explorable research artifacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            MyST Markdown's structured yet human-readable format makes research exceptionally accessible to AI systems and large language models (LLMs).
            Unlike proprietary formats or PDFs that obscure content structure, MyST preserves semantic meaning through its markup‚Äîequations remain
            interpretable, code blocks are clearly delineated, and citations maintain their relationships. This machine-readability enables AI agents
            to accurately extract methodologies, reproduce analyses, generate summaries, and synthesize findings across multiple papers.
          </p>
          <p>
            As research increasingly leverages AI for literature review, meta-analysis, and automated hypothesis generation, MyST's transparent structure ensures
            that published knowledge remains computationally accessible for decades to come, bridging human scholarship and artificial intelligence.
          </p>

          <h3>MyST Example</h3>
          <p>
            Here's an example of MyST frontmatter showing the rich metadata and easy markdown editing features available:

  This document describes a new algorithm implemented using the Insight Toolkit
  ITK (itk.org)..

  This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
  output data that the authors used for validating the algorithm described in
  this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific
  publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.

Automatic detection and tracking of the solar spot movements are of fundamental
importance for allowing the authors to dedicate more time to perfectioning
optical instruments and less time to the supervised acquisition of reliable
data.

\`\`\`{warning}
The reader should be warned that direct observation of the sun without proper
equipment may result in personal injury, loss of vision and burned brains.
\`\`\`

For questions on the basis of the scientific method the reader is referred to
{cite}\`Popper2002,Popper1971\`.

## Why Image Processing Papers must include Source Code, Images and Parameters

Papers to the Insight Journal are written in the spirit of facilitating and
encouraging readers to perform replication of work. In this sense, the Insight
Journal is compliant with essential concepts of the scientific method.

### Including Figures

\`\`\`{figure} ./assets/RegistrationComponentsDiagram.png
:name: fig-registration-components
:width: 80%

The basic components of the registration framework are two input images, a transform, a metric, an interpolator and an optimizer.
\`\`\`

### Mathematical Equations

To support shape-guidance, the generic level set equation
({eq}\`eqn-shape-influence-term\`) is extended to incorporate a shape guidance
term:

\`\`\`{math}
:label: eqn-shape-influence-term
\\xi \\left(\\psi^{*}(\\mathbf{x}) - \\psi(\\mathbf{x})\\right)
\`\`\`

### Code Examples

\`\`\`python
import itk

# Load an image
image = itk.imread('data/img1.png')

          <h3>What to Include in Your Submission</h3>
          <p>
            Complete research objects for the Insight Journal should include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Manuscript:</strong> Your paper in MyST or LaTeX format</li>
            <li><strong>Source Code:</strong> Complete, documented, buildable code</li>
            <li><strong>Data:</strong> Input datasets and examples</li>
            <li><strong>Parameters:</strong> Configuration files and settings</li>
            <li><strong>Results:</strong> Output data and visualizations</li>
            <li><strong>Build Instructions:</strong> pyproject.toml, CMakeLists.txt or equivalent</li>
            <li><strong>Tests:</strong> Validation and verification tests</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> README files and usage instructions</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- <h2>Submission Process via DeSci Nodes</h2>

          <h3>Step 1: Create a Research Object</h3>
          <p>
            Register on the DeSci Nodes platform and create a new research object. Upload all
            components of your submission:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Navigate to the DeSci Nodes platform</li>
            <li>Create a new Node for your research</li>
            <li>Upload your manuscript, code, data, and other materials</li>
            <li>Add metadata (title, abstract, authors, keywords)</li>
            <li>The platform will generate a DPID (persistent identifier) for your work</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 2: Claim Attestations</h3>
          <p>
            Indicate the openness and quality characteristics of your work by claiming attestations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Open Code:</strong> Source code is publicly available</li>
            <li><strong>Open Data:</strong> Datasets are shared openly</li>
            <li><strong>Reproducibility Enabled:</strong> All materials needed to reproduce results are included</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Claiming these attestations triggers review processes and, upon validation, adds these
            verified claims to the permanent record.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 3: Submit to Insight Journal</h3>
          <p>
            Once your research object is ready, submit it to the Insight Journal community for review.
            This triggers the open peer review process where referees and authors engage in public dialogue
            about the work.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 4: Engage with Peer Review</h3>
          <p>
            Respond to reviewer comments through the platform. All discussions are public and become
            part of the permanent record. Revise your work based on feedback and update your research
            object. Each version is preserved with its own DPID.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 5: Publication</h3>
          <p>
            When the editorial process is complete and your manuscript is accepted, a version-of-record
            DOI will be minted for the final published version. Your work will be indexed in CrossRef,
            OpenAlex, and Google Scholar, and contributors will receive automatic ORCID credit.
          </p>

          <h2>Become a Reviewer</h2>
          <p>
            Peer review is essential to maintaining the quality and integrity of published research.
            The Insight Journal recognizes the value of this service through:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Attribution:</strong> Your reviews are signed and become part of the
                permanent record</li>
            <li><strong>ORCID Credit:</strong> Automatic entries in your ORCID profile for review work</li>
            <li><strong>Reputation Building:</strong> Build your reputation through quality, constructive reviews</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Review Process</h3>
          <p>
            As a reviewer, you will:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Receive invitations to review submissions that match your expertise</li>
            <li>Access the complete research object (manuscript, code, data)</li>
            <li>Evaluate whether the work is reproducible by running the provided code</li>
            <li>Assess claims made in the manuscript against actual results</li>
            <li>Provide constructive feedback through public comments</li>
            <li>Validate or request changes to claimed attestations</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>What Makes a Good Review</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reproducibility Check:</strong> Did you successfully build and run the code?</li>
            <li><strong>Results Verification:</strong> Do the provided data and code produce the claimed results?</li>
            <li><strong>Methodological Soundness:</strong> Are the methods appropriate and well-described?</li>
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Is the manuscript clear and well-written?</li>
            <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Are all necessary materials included?</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Does the work make a meaningful contribution?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Open Peer Review</h3>
          <p>
            The Insight Journal practices open peer review where:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reviewers' identities are known to authors</li>
            <li>Reviews are public and part of the permanent record</li>
            <li>Author-reviewer dialogue happens in the open</li>
            <li>The community can see the evolution of the work through review</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This transparency increases accountability and trust while educating the broader community
            about quality standards.
          </p>
